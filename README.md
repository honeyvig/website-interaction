The script uses Beautiful Soup for web scraping, Requests for making HTTP requests, and NLTK for basic text analysis. It doesnâ€™t cover paid advertising APIs due to their complexity and need for specific configurations.

Key Features:

    Web Scraping: Uses Beautiful Soup to scrape and analyze web content.
    Randomized Visits: Randomly selects URLs from a predefined list and waits for a random interval between visits.
    Text Analysis: Uses NLTK for basic text analysis, such as counting words.

How to Use:

    Install the necessary libraries using pip:

    bash

    pip install beautifulsoup4 requests nltk

    Add your target URLs to the urls_to_visit list.
    Run the script. It will continuously visit the URLs at random intervals.

Ethical Considerations:

    Ensure that the websites you are visiting allow scraping in their robots.txt file.
    Avoid sending too many requests in a short period to prevent overwhelming the server.
    Always comply with the terms of service of the websites you interact with.
